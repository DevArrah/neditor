'\n Gaminol, the Master of hellfire, is a fearsome vamp who serves as an' +
'\n Advocate Guild Master in the Necromancer\'s Guild.  He wields a' +
'\n fearsome Staff of Impatience.  He is a difficult kill, not because he' +
'\n hits hard or has a lot of hp but because he runs away from fights and' +
'\n rope tricks frequently.  Seek him in the Necromancer\'s guild, where' +
'\n he is likely to be flapping or bugging Moonwallace and Lauranna.' +

'\n The Staff of Impatience (tm) is the powerful staff of Gaminol.  It is' +
'\n tipped with taloned receptacle into which the wielder can insert one' +
'\n of many interchangable orbs.  The orbs give the staff the power of' +
'\n versatility in function.  Gaminol guards this staff jealously and' +
'\n uses it frequently, although on occasion he will lend it to his' +
'\n fellow admin or trade it for the Whip of Testiness (tm).' +
