 Gaminol, the Master of hellfire, is a fearsome vamp who serves as an
 Advocate Guild Master in the Necromancer's Guild.  He wields a
 fearsome Staff of Impatience.  He is a difficult kill, not because he
 hits hard or has a lot of hp but because he runs away from fights and
 rope tricks frequently.  Seek him in the Necromancer's guild, where
 he is likely to be flapping or bugging Moonwallace and Lauranna.

 The Staff of Impatience (tm) is the powerful staff of Gaminol.  It is
 tipped with taloned receptacle into which the wielder can insert one
 of many interchangable orbs.  The orbs give the staff the power of
 versatility in function.  Gaminol guards this staff jealously and
 uses it frequently, although on occasion he will lend it to his
 fellow admin or trade it for the Whip of Testiness (tm).

 Not much is known about this amulet other than Lauranna wears it
 around her neck frequently.  It is suspected that it induces her
 otherwise angelic personality to cackle and grin evilly.

 These orbs complement Gaminol's Staff of Impatience.  Little is known
 about their function, or even the number of orbs in existence.  Their
 exact characteristics are likely to vary over time depending on
 Gaminol's memory and his whims.  The following orbs are known:
 
 Iridescent Orb of No-Ports-For You 
 Greenbean Orb of Troublesome Marquis Bopping
 Crimson Orb of Troublemaking
